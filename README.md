A presence/activity indicator using keybow. Nothing (for now) to see here).

Shopping list:
  - Raspberry Pi Model Zero (the last hassle is getting the WH model which has wifi and headers already on).
  - Pimoroni [Keybow](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/keybow) or Keybow MINI (I'm using a Mini but will aim to have it work for both).
